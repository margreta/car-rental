## **1. Introduction**
This program is a car rental booking system that allows the car rental company to easily create and manage bookings in addition to keep the car fleet updated. The system has two paths, admin and dealer, where the admin has its own actions and dealer has another. The admin is the controller, the one who can manipulate the fleet (for example add a new car to the system or remove one). The dealer is the employee who interacts with the customer and therefore is the main user of the system. 
The goal of this system is to make every day work easier for those in the car rental business.  

## **2. Data**
The program uses two csv datasets, one named cars.csv and another named booking.csv.
You can find them here: (https://github.com/margreta/car-rental/tree/master/Iceberg_classes/data)

Cars.csv contains information about all registered cars. The cars attributes are their license plate number, type of the car inside the system (type A, type B and type C), the price per day and its availability (rented, available or unavailable). 

booking.csv contains information about the customer who has ever made a reservation with the company. Therefore the attributes for each booking are the name of the customer, the customer drivers license, email, phone number, credit card information for the insurance (card number, validation time and the cvc number), booking starting date and end date, the license plate of the car he has rented along with its type and price, the extras he has asked for and how he will pay for the rental and last the status of the booking (deleted or new). 

This system allows the user to look up specific data to find in each of those datasets. For example if the employee needs to check status of some car he can look it up by its license plate number and all information regarding that specific car will show up on the screen. Also if employee needs to look up specific customer he can simply do so by entering the customers email and all information regarding that customer will show up on the screen.
